                  It is with great pleasure that we can report that 2023 was a
                  good year for Hotel con Corazón. In our three countries we
                  have made considerable progress compared to 2022, and 2024
                  looks even more promising!

                  <p>
                    Our students continue with their school, some graduate,
                    others have improved their financial situation and no longer
                    need the scholarship. For the current year 2024, we have
                    enrolled more students than have left, growing the program
                    from 26 to 32 students. Tourism is now steadily increasing
                    and is getting close to pre-pandemic levels. We are hiring
                    more staff, we are renovating our building, to be prepared
                    for further growth. We are pleased that our hotel in Granada
                    in back on the rise!

                    We have finalized our transition to carry out our education
                    programs through two partner NGOs instead of our own direct
                    involvements as we did in the early years. By becoming a
                    stable financial partner of these NGOs, both can grow the
                    number of supported students to over 300. And then tourism
                    in Oaxaca, what more is there to say? As the Mexican tourism
                    hotspot that it is, this situation allowed our hotel to
                    perform again stronger in 2023 than the year before, with
                    average occupancy at an incredible 91%.

                    Our ambition of adding a third hotel in the mountain village
                    of Monteverde is getting closer and closer. Most of the past
                    year was dedicated to design, costing, permit work, and the
                    selection of a construction company. Finally, in the
                    first week of December, we started the construction. At the
                    time of writing this report, the planning for the grand
                    opening of the hotel is April 2025.

            <p>
              At the end of 2022, our esteemed co-founder Onno Oostveen
              announced that after more than 16 years of dedicated service to
              Hotel con Corazón, it was time for him to explore new professional
              opportunities. He remained with us throughout 2023 to contribute
              to the Costa Rica project and ensure a smooth transition of his
              responsibilities by year's end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without Onno’s entrepreneurial vision, Hotel con Corazón would not
              have come into existence. He also made our journey a lot more fun.
              The two years Onno and co-founder Marcel spent in Nicaragua to
              establish the first hotel were unforgettable for both of them and
              all the volunteers that came to contribute to the hotel. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years, his visits to the existing hotels to provide
              support and drive professional development have been invaluable to
              the hotel managers. Onno, you will be greatly missed, and
              remember: "You can check out, but you can never leave.”

                the tourism influx in Nicaragua, however our focus has always
                been on funding the commitment of 26 re-entry scholarships of
                various modalities and majors so that students who already had a
                benefit with us could finish their studies. We achieved this
                through our savings funds, but mainly with support from a
                crowdfunding campaign carried out around Christmas. Thanks to
                this collective cooperation organized by our headquarters in The
                Netherlands, we have been able to obtain, through donations, the
                funds to carry out our annual budget and financial projections
                of our educational project this year. Unfortunately, we were
                still not able to sustain the project with hotel profits in
                2023, a model with which we have operated before tourism
                declined in Nicaragua. Luckily 2024 promises to reverse that
                trend.

              <p>
                Most of our high school scholarship students come from the rural
                area of Granada, specifically the Laguna region, where these
                children have attended primary school in public schools with
                limited resources. The schools lack the tools, facilities, and
                staff to meet the educational needs of the large number of
                students they serve, as well as the development of a
                comprehensive curriculum. These primary schools have multiple
                grades in a single classroom with only one teacher, and English
                or technology classes are not offered. School dropout rates are
                very high because very few parents are conscious about the
                importance of having their children continue their studies after
                the 6th grade. Moreover, the children often need to help with
                the fieldwork that most of these families engage in within the
                community.
              </p>

                The children from these rural schools, Bertha Pacheco and San
                Pablo School, who graduate from 6th grade and wish to continue
                their studies, can apply for a scholarship at the Hotel con
                Corazón Foundation.

                The initial transition for them is challenging, as the
                scholarship they receive from us for their secondary education
                are used at a more demanding high school in the urban area. One
                of the most relevant guidelines, in addition to their grades,
                when we grant a scholarship, is a socioeconomic study conducted
                for each application, as the scholarship covers only tuition
                fees and support, so parents must be able to pay for
                transportation to school, uniforms, and school supplies. Once
                the scholarship is obtained, the students must attend the
                hotel's tutoring classes after school, provided by our
                university scholarship students. We do not offer any additional
                classes or techniques outside of their school curriculum.

              <p>
                Our first candidates to be awarded university scholarships are
                our own high school scholarship recipients who have graduated
                from high school. Our mission with university students has
                focused on providing them with their first work experiences.
                Every student who receives a university scholarship is committed
                to attending one day per week to work in different areas of the
                hotel, rotating them through various departments. Regardless of
                their major, we want them to experience teamwork and customer
                service, overcome shyness, and learn values such as workplace
                respect, ethics, responsibility in assigned tasks, humility, and
                solidarity during their day at Hotel con Corazón. Our university
                students also give tutoring classes to our high school students.
                They ‘return’ the support they received by imparting knowledge
                to these children from their community, providing tutoring to
                help with their homework, assisting with printing, or conducting
                research  ̶   essentially providing any support needed for their
                schoolwork. During lunchtime, all the scholarship recipients
                gather with the staff to share a meal, providing an opportunity
                to discuss their doubts, difficulties, and questions; of course,
                there's always room for a joke or two. The staff strives to
                ensure that those young people feel included and part of the
                team.

                During the year 2023, the team remained small, with a total of 8
                members, half of whom requested scholarships. As a benefit to
                the employees, they can receive an additional 10% of their
                earned salary for university studies, technical courses,
                language courses, etc., that the employee wishes to pursue
                directly. Alternatively, 5% of the earned salary is allocated
                for the education of their own children. This benefit for our
                employees is provided to  encourage ongoing education for
                personal and professional growth. It helps them to deliver
                excellent service at the hotel, which generates the funds
                necessary to make this entire educational project possible.

                In Nicaragua, the highest percentages of enrollment are obtained
                during primary school and the first two years of secondary
                school. However, after the age of 15, enrollment drops
                considerably, to such an extent that only 15% of the population
                applies to technical or vocational education.

                In 2023 we stepped up our efforts on our educational projects.
                We intensified our close collaborations with NGO’s The Oaxaca
                Learning Center and Mundo de Talentos. Together, we implemented
                and evaluated our professional orientation program, developed a
                new scholarship program and continued education activities in
                our class rooms at the hotel. The execution of the programs is
                done by our local partners, Hotel con Corazón is one of the
                bigger co-funders, deploys expertise and knowledge in the
                development and evaluation of the programs and facilitates
                materials, space and practical support whenever possible.

                Mundo de Talentos offers vocational training to children, aged
                10 to 13, in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south of
                Mexico. Children get introduced to interesting professions and
                study subjects through an intensive two-year program, offered
                each Saturday. Passionate professionals (volunteers) share their
                work experiences and invite children to learn in a participative
                manner about possible career opportunities. The project
                motivates the inclusion, curiosity, and empathy of children, by
                sharing real-life experiences in subjects as diverse as
                philosophy, medicine, the arts, biology, architecture,
                journalism and many others.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main focus of the project caters to children from families
                who would otherwise not have access to vocational training. As a
                result, non-profit Mundo de Talentos primarily serves public
                school students. Around 80 new students participate in the
                program yearly.

              to the university. Very few times I have the time to have
              breakfast, because I have to be ready in time to take the bus at
              5:30 am to Managua, 45 kilometers from home. My first class starts
              at 7 am, I receive my theory classes in the morning at the
              university, and in my first break I go get some breakfast to
              continue with the day. At 11 am I finish my theory classes, I look
              for something to eat for lunch or sometimes I bring food from
              home.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am ready to take a bus to Masaya at 12 pm, to the Hospital
              Sermesa de Masaya where I do my clinical practice, where at this
              moment I rotate in the surgical area. After having marked my
              attendance at the hospital, I take a cab to go to the outpatient
              clinic which is located 20 minutes away from the hospital. Here is
              where my transition from medical student to pre-intern doctor is
              taking place.
            </p>
            <p>
              We start attending patients asking why they came to the clinic and
              we are in charge of taking vital signs, doing physical examination
              and transcribing prescriptions with the supervision of a medical
              specialist. We ask the specialist questions about the patient's
              pathology and so on while we wait for the next one. Each
              pre-internship doctor gets a week in the operating room. If there
              is an emergency surgery we have the privilege of attending, I have
              been present in a few unusual cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is my day to day, undoubtedly an adventure a little tiring,
              but full of many emotions, learning and beautiful experiences."

                  continue studying. It felt good because I have met
                  extraordinary new people who in one way or another have made
                  my life. Coming from so far away and having so many things
                  happen during the day, I feel like sometimes I can't do it
                  anymore, but when I get here and I am surrounded by my
                  classmates, my friends and all of us who are part of the
                  scholarship program, I feel very comfortable. The workshop
                  leaders have been very kind people and have made us feel like
                  family. Very few times I have been able to feel that
                  atmosphere of being in a family as I feel here. I have found
                  the whole scholarship program to be extraordinary because I
                  have learned about topics that I did not know. From my resume
                  to coping with stress and anxiety. Also, how to organize
                  yourself with your bullet journal was very good because I was
                  very disorganized and now I have managed to organize my life
                  and not be so forgetful. It has been an excellent program that
                  I will continue to participate in.

                <p class="student-article">
                  "I come on Tuesdays and Thursdays to math tutoring. I really
                  like these sessions because I see the topics in a broader way
                  than in school. I also take courses on Saturdays, which I like
                  a lot because I am a very introverted person and at the Oaxaca
                  Learning Center I get psychological counseling. The
                  psychologist has told me that if I want to develop myself a
                  bit more I can try to be more participative. The truth for me
                  is that the Saturday courses help me, because I give my
                  opinion on topics and I have never been teased or felt
                  uncomfortable in the program.
                </p>
                <p class="student-article no-border">
                  I like the program a lot. I feel that it focuses on good
                  areas, for example mathematics and physics. I also feel that
                  the Oaxaca Learning Center gives you a lot of information so
                  that you are informed and learn better. It teaches you a lot
                  of study techniques and gives you many tools. The tutors and
                  all the people I have met here are very friendly. I feel that
                  they also reinforce the camaraderie between everyone.

                <p class="student-article no-border">
                  The career I am choosing is business management engineering
                  which is at the Oaxacan Technological Institute. I like this
                  career because it is multidisciplinary so I can start working
                  in various fields."

                  "I really like Mundo de Talentos because I am learning to be
                  more social and work as a team, and I have a lot of fun. I am
                  also learning about professions and crafts that I did not know
                  about before. I have had fun in all the sessions but I have
                  been interested in three in particular: podcasts, medicine,
                  but the one that interested me the most is art. When I grow up
                  I'm going to paint murals in tourist places and poor
                  communities, something related to our culture. I would like to
                  give workshops to teach children to draw and paint because I
                  believe children should express what they feel. Art helps us
                  to imagine and when we can express it we feel happy."

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Our year was well planned, as we ended with an occupancy rate
                  of 50% exactly as foreseen. Tourism in Nicaragua is coming
                  back after difficult years. Airlines have opened more flights
                  so international tourism (especially European) has increased
                  considerably.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This year, after several years, we achieved our first
                  operating profits again. The necessary staff was hired to
                  ensure quality operations for our guests. We also invested a
                  modest amount in renovating our rooms. This was done in order
                  to offer a better comfort and at the same time has allowed us
                  to gradually increase our rates.
                </p>

                  In 2023 we also celebrated our 15th anniversary! Co-founder
                  Onno Oostveen joined in this special celebration where we
                  invited scholarship holders and former scholarship holders,
                  staff and former staff, suppliers, partners and hotel friends
                  to celebrate with us the effort, dedication and achievements
                  that we have built together.

                  &rarr;&nbsp;The year in brief
                </h3>
                <p>
                  2023 was an extremely good year for our hotel in Oaxaca. We
                  witnessed the tremendous increase in the popularity of Oaxaca
                  since the pandemic, and the great interest from all over the
                  world in visiting the city. With an average occupancy of no
                  less than 91%, we experienced our best year since the hotel
                  opened in 2018. It took a lot of hard work and motivation from
                  our staff to keep up and meet the high expectations created by
                  the online reviews. But we made it through, and once again
                  this year many guests have expressed exceptionally
                  appreciative comments about our great service, the beautiful
                  installations, the helpfulness of the staff, the excellent
                  breakfast and last but not least our highly valued social
                  focus.
                </p>

                />
                <p>
                  This year was also an important year for us as we celebrated
                  our fifth anniversary in June. With a lavish party for our
                  staff, suppliers and friends, the moment did not go
                  unnoticed! 
                </p>

                <p>
                  We are pleased with our 2023 results and we are confident that
                  we will continue to make our guests feel happy and at home
                  while supporting our social mission.

                "Excellent experience all around. I moved here after staying my
                first couple nights at another (more expensive) hotel close by
                and immediately wished I had booked my entire Granada vacation
                here! Everything from the friendly, professional staff to the
                very clean room and pool area was fantastic. The room was
                minimalist, but had everything needed and was very comfortable
                (it appeared like perhaps it had been recently renovated). The
                breakfast was solid and service was fast. I wish every hotel in
                Nicaragua had the same standards. I highly recommend staying
                here."

                "I would recommend this place to anyone. It’s got a fresh modern
                feel with very comfortable beds and nice spaces for relaxing.
                The breakfasts are delicious, substantial and lovingly
                presented. But above all, it’s the warmth of the people who work
                here that make it different from so many other hotels. You can
                tell they care about the hotel and its educational projects and
                that the hotel in turn cares about them. It feels very simple
                and homely – everything you could need (and nothing you don’t).
                The location is also great…"

                staff were friendly and flexible; A/C in our room; breakfast was

                booked multiple tours and cooking classes through the hotel, and
                had positive experiences at each one. They took great care of

            I get up at 5:00 in the morning, brush my teeth, then I get ready to
            go out to do exercise, I return home at 6:00 and I freshen up a bit
            taking a bath, I get ready, have breakfast, brush my teeth again and
            leave my house at 6:40 to be at work at 7:00.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I arrive I wish my coworkers a good morning, and I proceed to
            perform my corresponding tasks: cleaning public areas, helping my
            coworkers in the kitchen, assisting customers, serving breakfast and
            washing dishes. When I finish helping them, I go to my area to clean
            the rooms, either for departure or stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 10:30 I clean the breakfast area, bar and tutoring area, at 12:30
            I have lunch with my colleagues, we finish lunch, I wash the dishes
            I used, I go to the laundry to wash and fold the bed linen and
            towels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then at 3:00 pm I clean the public areas and leave everything in
            order. My shift ends at 3:30 pm.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I get home, I freshen up a bit and get ready to bring my
            little brother to school, he leaves at 5:30 pm. I am a big fan of
            practicing sports, so in the evenings I play soccer for an hour or
            so and then I go home to have dinner, watch TV for a while and then
            go to sleep!

            My day starts between 6 and 7 in the morning. When I wake up, the
            first thing I like to do is to comtemplate the tender rays of the
            sun from my window and sit down to write down all my tasks and
            activities for the day, that is, my routine, from eating breakfast
            to work in the hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of my morning routine is to have breakfast, clean my room,
            embroider and make beaded bracelets because I love handicrafts, make
            accounts of my finances, attend to a social and environmental
            project that some friends and I do in a kindergarden in the
            community of Atzompa. I do laundry, do some graphic design and
            update the social networks of the Huertonitos Urbanos (Urban
            Vegetable Gardens) collective of which I am a part.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early afternoon I start getting ready to go to the hotel,
            where my shift starts at 3:00 pm. I shower, take my backpack and my
            bicycle - my main means of transportation - and leave home at 14:50,
            because I live near the hotel and it takes me less than 10 minutes
            to get there.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I start my shift, my morning reception colleague shares with me
            the details and pendings of the day, I count the petty cash and
            check how many reservations are still to arrive; I review and answer
            emails, as well as any request or question from our guests or future
            guests who contact us through the platforms or call us on the phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every other week on Mondays, at the beginning of my shift, I
            participate in the English class for the staff, offered by the
            hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I usually take some time for lunch, then I clean up my
            area according to the schedule, go up to the terraces to check that
            the water stations are stocked, the chairs arranged, and take care
            of the herb garden if necessary; I greet guests for check-in and
            tell them along the way about the hotel's mission and how they
            support the local community.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so at 8 pm, it's my turn to greet my night watch colleague, with
            whom I also exchange details of occupancy and pending things.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 9 pm onwards I start closing my shift by making the day's bar
            charges to the respective room accounts. I close the card charge
            account via a report, count petty cash, print out the list of
            overnights for the night watch and the next day's checkout list for
            the morning shift. Then I write down the last indications in the log
            book, and at 10 pm I go home, to rest lying down reading a book or
            consulting my cell phone for a while until I fall asleep around 11
            or 11:30 pm, thus recharging batteries for a new day.

                The recovery of tourism in Nicaragua is reflected in our
                figures. With occupancy reaching 50% and room rates steadily
                increasing, our operating profits are starting to improve.
                Unfortunately, we still have some overdue projects in terms of
                maintenance, renovation and improvements, which is reflected in
                the extraordinary costs. It means the hotel is still not able to
                contribute enough to the education projects, but we expect this
                to change next year.

                After a record breaking 2022, this past year showed an even
                better performance. Oaxaca continues to be one of the top
                tourist destinations in Latin American, which is noticeable in
                our occupancy and room rates. Increases in room rates and the
                three additional rooms we built in early 2023 have contributed
                to revenues. It required a small increase in housekeeping and
                kitchen staff, but, as can be seen, the profit margin has
                increased significantly.

                For the Monteverde hotel in Costa Rica (hotel number 3) we
                expect construction to be completed in January 2025, with the
                hotel scheduled to open on April 1. At the time of writing, all
                three buildings are taking shape, with the three story main
                building being the priority.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are currently evaluating different options for hotel number
                4. Given the steady increase in tourism and success of our
                current hotel in that city, we are considering a second hotel in
                Oaxaca. In parallel, we are evaluating opportunities in San
                Cristóbal de las Casas in the neighboring state of Chiapas, as
                well as a beach hotel on the coast of Oaxaca.

                At the end of 2023 several of our students graduated and others
                were no longer eligible for scholarships, either because their
                financial situation had improved or because their motivation had
                dropped to unacceptable levels. We recruited more students and
                started 2024 with 32 students, 18 of whom are university
                students, thanks in part to increased hotel profits.

                With the resumption of flights to Managua from major U.S.
                airlines, there are now 16 international arrivals per day, a
                sign that international tourism is clearly on the mend. We are
                benefiting from many Costa Rican tour operators adding Nicaragua
                to their group itineraries. In summary, 2024 will produce
                revenues surpassing US$ 200,000 and operating profits of US$
                60,000.

                Our work with partner The Oaxaca Learning Center continues to be
                very fruitful. After 3 years, in June they will complete the
                renovation of their building and will be fully operational again
                with functioning classrooms, a computer space sponsored by Hotel
                con Corazón, office space for staff and recreation space for the
                students. Their goal of reaching over 200 students will easily
                be exceeded this year. We are excited with our extended
                partnership in Oaxaca with NGO Mundo de Talentos. They are
                expected to start a second cohort of students in a village
                outside of Oaxaca in September 2024, growing from 60 to 80
                students. 
              </p>
              <p>
                At the hotel, the first 5 months of 2024 are showing strong
                occupancy and booking levels, in line with record levels in
                2023. We expect revenues to reach US$ 725,000 and net profits of
                US$ 208,000.
              </p>

                In early 2024, it became clear that water scarcity would become
                an urgent problem in Oaxaca and would only increase in the
                future. Therefore, in May 2024, we will install a water
                treatment plant to irrigate our plants with treated water
                instead of drinking water. Once this plant is fully operational,
                we also expect to install gray water treatment later in 2024,
                adding another element to our responsible operations. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For the first time in our operations, we expect to pay a
                dividend to our investors who contributed to the construction of
                the Oaxaca hotel. It makes us extremely proud, as it is a sign
                that we have transformed from a nonprofit to a social
                enterprise.
