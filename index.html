                <p>
                  It is with great pleasure that we can report that 2023 was a
                  good year for Hotel con Corazón. In our three countries we
                  have made considerable progress compared to 2022, and 2024
                  looks even more promising!
                </p>

                  <h4>Nicaragua</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our students continue with their school, some graduate,
                    others have improved their financial situation and no longer
                    need the scholarship. For the current year 2024, we have
                    enrolled more students than have left, growing the program
                    from 26 to 32 students. Tourism is now steadily increasing
                    and is getting close to pre-pandemic levels. We are hiring
                    more staff, we are renovating our building, to be prepared
                    for further growth. We are pleased that our hotel in Granada
                    is back on the rise!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We have finalized our transition to carry out our education
                    programs through two partner NGOs instead of our own direct
                    involvements as we did in the early years. By becoming a
                    stable financial partner of these NGOs, both can grow the
                    number of supported students to over 300. And then tourism
                    in Oaxaca, what more is there to say? As the Mexican tourism
                    hotspot that it is, this situation allowed our hotel to
                    perform again stronger in 2023 than the year before, with
                    average occupancy at an incredible 91%.

                    Our ambition of adding a third hotel in the mountain village
                    of Monteverde is getting closer and closer. Most of the past
                    year was dedicated to design, costing, permit work, and the
                    selection of a construction company. Finally, in the first
                    week of December, we started the construction. At the time
                    of writing this report, the planning for the grand opening
                    of the hotel is April 2025.

              At the end of 2022, our esteemed co-founder Onno Oostveen
              announced that after more than 16 years of dedicated service to
              Hotel con Corazón, it was time for him to explore new professional
              opportunities. He remained with us throughout 2023 to contribute
              to the Costa Rica project and ensure a smooth transition of his
              responsibilities by year's end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without Onno's entrepreneurial vision, Hotel con Corazón would not
              have come into existence. He also made our journey a lot more fun.
              The two years Onno and co-founder Marcel spent in Nicaragua to
              establish the first hotel were unforgettable for both of them and
              all the volunteers that came to contribute to the hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years, his visits to the existing hotels to provide
              support and drive professional development have been invaluable to
              the hotel managers. Onno, you will be greatly missed, and
              remember: "You can check out, but you can never leave.”

                At the beginning of 2023, we still did not have a clear picture
                of the influx of tourism in Nicaragua, but our focus was on
                renewing the scholarships of 26 existing students of different
                modalities and majors so that they could complete their studies.
                We achieved this through a crowdfunding campaign conducted
                around Christmas. Thanks to these collective efforts of ex-hotel
                guests and long-time Corazón supporters, we were able to carry
                out our educational project this year. And although last year we
                were still unable to fund the education project with hotel
                profits, 2024 promises to reverse that trend.

                <p>
                  Most of our high school scholarship students come from the
                  rural area of Granada, specifically the Laguna region, where
                  these children have attended primary school in public schools
                  with limited resources. The schools lack the tools,
                  facilities, and staff to meet the educational needs of the
                  large number of students they serve, as well as the
                  development of a comprehensive curriculum. These primary
                  schools have multiple grades in a single classroom with only
                  one teacher, and English or technology classes are not
                  offered. School dropout rates are very high because very few
                  parents are conscious about the importance of having their
                  children continue their studies after the 6th grade. Moreover,
                  the children often need to help with the fieldwork that most
                  of these families engage in within the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The children from these rural schools, Bertha Pacheco and San
                  Pablo School, who graduate from 6th grade and wish to continue
                  their studies, can apply for a scholarship at the Hotel con
                  Corazón Foundation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The initial transition for them is challenging, as the
                  scholarship they receive from us for their secondary education
                  are used at a more demanding high school in the urban area.
                  One of the most relevant guidelines, in addition to their
                  grades, when we grant a scholarship, is a socioeconomic study
                  conducted for each application, as the scholarship covers only
                  tuition fees and support, so parents must be able to pay for
                  transportation to school, uniforms, and school supplies. Once
                  the scholarship is obtained, the students must attend the
                  hotel's tutoring classes after school, provided by our
                  university scholarship students. We do not offer any
                  additional classes or techniques outside of their school
                  curriculum.

                <p>
                  Our first candidates to be awarded university scholarships are
                  our own high school scholarship recipients who have graduated
                  from high school. Our mission with university students has
                  focused on providing them with their first work experiences.
                  Every student who receives a university scholarship is
                  committed to attending one day per week to work in different
                  areas of the hotel, rotating them through various departments.
                  Regardless of their major, we want them to experience teamwork
                  and customer service, overcome shyness, and learn values such
                  as workplace respect, ethics, responsibility in assigned
                  tasks, humility, and solidarity during their day at Hotel con
                  Corazón. Our university students also give tutoring classes to
                  our high school students. They 'return' the support they
                  received by imparting knowledge to these children from their
                  community, providing tutoring to help with their homework,
                  assisting with printing, or conducting research - essentially
                  providing any support needed for their schoolwork. During
                  lunchtime, all the scholarship recipients gather with the
                  staff to share a meal, providing an opportunity to discuss
                  their doubts, difficulties, and questions; of course, there's
                  always room for a joke or two. The staff strives to ensure
                  that those young people feel included and part of the team.

                  8 members, half of whom requested scholarships. As a benefit
                  to the employees, they can receive an additional 10% of their
                  earned salary for university studies, technical courses,
                  language courses, etc., that the employee wishes to pursue
                  directly. Alternatively, 5% of the earned salary is allocated

              In 2023 we stepped up our efforts on our educational projects. We
              intensified our close collaborations with NGO's The Oaxaca
              Learning Center and Mundo de Talentos. Together, we implemented
              and evaluated our professional orientation program, developed a
              new scholarship program and continued education activities in our
              class rooms at the hotel. The execution of the programs is done by
              our local partners, Hotel con Corazón is one of the bigger
              co-funders, deploys expertise and knowledge in the development and
              evaluation of the programs and facilitates materials, space and
              practical support whenever possible.

                <p>
                  Mundo de Talentos offers vocational training to children, aged
                  10 to 13, in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south of
                  Mexico. Children get introduced to interesting professions and
                  study subjects through an intensive two-year program, offered
                  each Saturday. Passionate professionals (volunteers) share
                  their work experiences and invite children to learn in a
                  participative manner about possible career opportunities. The
                  project motivates the inclusion, curiosity, and empathy of
                  children, by sharing real-life experiences in subjects as
                  diverse as philosophy, medicine, the arts, biology,
                  architecture, journalism and many others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main focus of the project caters to children from families
                  who would otherwise not have access to vocational training. As
                  a result, non-profit Mundo de Talentos primarily serves public
                  school students. Around 80 new students participate in the
                  program yearly.

                  aged 14 to 24, to succeed academically and to gain confidence
                  to develop and meet their personal goals. At the center,
                  students receive academic tutoring, mentoring, and personal
                  support within a holistic learning community. Staff and tutors
                  are from the same background as the students. Many are
                  graduates of the center and serve as inspiring role models.
                  The objective of the program is to develop skills,
                  self-confidence, and leadership in the students.

                  In 2023 Mundo de Talentos (MdT) announced the official opening
                  of the second Mundo de Talentos branch in Oaxaca City, after a
                  succesful pilot launched together in November 2022. In 2023,
                  we continued with the same group of 20 students, from January
                  to June 2023. MdT organized a variety of vocational sessions
                  on topics like theatre, videomaking, firefighting,
                  entrepreneurship, tourism, integral health, and technology and
                  innovation. The enthusiastic response of the students and
                  their parents and Mundo de Talentos' positive experience in
                  Oaxaca motivated the non-profit to continue activities in the
                  city. In September 2023, Mundo de Talentos started its second
                  year in Oaxaca with a total of 60 students and with modules
                  about arts, integral health, science, architecture and an
                  investigation project. Each module consists of four sessions,
                  thus offering a detailed introduction to the subject matter.

                  As part of the tourism session, 20 students visited our hotel,
                  where they simulated a check-in and got to know different
                  professions and areas of our hotel. Our staff did a great job
                  demonstrating and explaining their daily work. Another fact
                  worth mentioning is that two students from The Oaxaca Learning
                  Center are volunteering with Mundo de Talentos every Saturday.
                  This shows that our two partner organizations have found and
                  reinforce each other in their goal to help students developing
                  their potential.

                  In the summer of 2023 we developed a new scholarship program
                  together with TOLC and another major donor of theirs. The
                  scholarship program offers four types of scholarships:
                  Academic, School Internships, Temporary Employment and a
                  Technical Scholarship. The main goal is to help young people
                  continue their high school and university studies, as well as
                  to train them for the labour market. The scholarship consists
                  of two components: financial support during their time in
                  school and a formative component to strengthen personal and
                  professional skills. At the end of 2023, together with FOLC,
                  we selected four high school students and five university
                  students for the scholarship program.

                  2023, 57 students participated in the English program. The
                  hotel also served as a host for several English exchanges
                  between students and English speakers.

                  This service helps students prepare for the admission exam to
                  high school or university. It provides guidance and reinforces
                  knowledge to increase the chances of passing the exam. In
                  2023, 17 students participated of which 16 were admitted to
                  high school or university.

                  preparation as a volunteer and Kenia participated in the
                  formal integration program to prepare for university, where
                  she was eventually admitted.

                  This course offers creative, sports and educational activities
                  that promote learning and personal development. In 2023, the
                  summer school was organized again in Zaachila Oriente, a
                  low-income community close to Oaxaca, in collaboration with
                  local partners. 35 junior high and high school students
                  participated. 22 students enrolled in the regular integral
                  formation program with a new external teacher based in
                  Zaachila Oriente. We are pleased that our cooperation with
                  local partners in Zaachila and TOLC was at the base of this
                  fruitful collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also supported five primary schools in Zaachila Oriente
                  with school materials.

                  From January to October 2023 we executed our Professional
                  Orientation pilot. 16 students received 25 group tutoring
                  sessions and 56 individual sessions, three workshops, nine
                  professional orientation sessions and five workshops for their
                  parents. Together with Randstad Mexico we developed a workshop
                  about resume making and job interviews. The general objective
                  of the pilot was to discover the ambition of the students.
                  Children of our staff and staff members also participated. The
                  evaluation showed that students learned more about themselves
                  and that ideas of what they want to study became clearer. As a
                  result we decided to integrate the individual and group
                  coaching sessions and workshops in the regular TOLC services.

                  In 2023 we signed three agreements with high schools dedicated
                  to offering internships in our hotel. Unfortunately we only
                  welcomed one student from CONALEP, a vocational high school.
                  Two university students cancelled last minute because they did
                  not pass their courses. Our aim in 2024 is to receive more
                  interns in our hotel. It is also part of our new scholarship
                  program together with TOLC.

                  56 kilos of school supplies in 2023, brought by 26 guests in
                  their suitcases.

                  In Oaxaca State, the average grade of schooling for the
                  population aged 15 and over is 8.1 years, which is equivalent
                  to just over the second year of junior high school, almost 2
                  years less than at national level. On average in the OECD,
                  people can expect to go through about 18 years of education.

                "My day starts at 4:30 am every day, I wake up and get ready to
                go to the university. Very few times I have the time to have
                breakfast, because I have to be ready in time to take the bus at
                5:30 am to Managua, 45 kilometers from home. My first class
                starts at 7 am, I receive my theory classes in the morning at
                the university, and in my first break I go get some breakfast to
                continue with the day. At 11 am I finish my theory classes, I
                look for something to eat for lunch or sometimes I bring food
                from home.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am ready to take a bus to Masaya at 12 pm, to the Hospital
                Sermesa de Masaya where I do my clinical practice, where at this
                moment I rotate in the surgical area. After having marked my
                attendance at the hospital, I take a cab to go to the outpatient
                clinic which is located 20 minutes away from the hospital. Here
                is where my transition from medical student to pre-intern doctor
                is taking place.
              </p>
              <p>
                We start attending patients asking why they came to the clinic
                and we are in charge of taking vital signs, doing physical
                examination and transcribing prescriptions with the supervision
                of a medical specialist. We ask the specialist questions about
                the patient's pathology and so on while we wait for the next
                one. Each pre-internship doctor gets a week in the operating
                room. If there is an emergency surgery we have the privilege of
                attending, I have been present in a few unusual cases.
              </p>
              <p>

                but full of many emotions, learning and beautiful experiences."

                here and I am surrounded by my classmates, my friends and all of
                us who are part of the scholarship program, I feel very
                comfortable. The workshop leaders have been very kind people and
                have made us feel like family. Very few times I have been able
                to feel that atmosphere of being in a family as I feel here. I
                have found the whole scholarship program to be extraordinary
                because I have learned about topics that I did not know. From my
                resume to coping with stress and anxiety. Also, how to organize
                yourself with your bullet journal was very good because I was
                very disorganized and now I have managed to organize my life and
                not be so forgetful. It has been an excellent program that I

                Learning Center I get psychological counseling. The psychologist
                has told me that if I want to develop myself a bit more I can
                try to be more participative. The truth for me is that the
                Saturday courses help me, because I give my opinion on topics

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Our year was well planned, as we ended with an occupancy rate
                  of 50% exactly as foreseen. Tourism in Nicaragua is coming
                  back after difficult years. Airlines have opened more flights
                  so international tourism (especially European) has increased
                  considerably.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This year, after several years, we achieved our first
                  operating profits again. The necessary staff was hired to
                  ensure quality operations for our guests. We also invested a
                  modest amount in renovating our rooms. This was done in order
                  to offer a better comfort and at the same time has allowed us
                  to gradually increase our rates.
                </p>

                  In 2023 we also celebrated our 15th anniversary! Co-founder
                  Onno Oostveen joined in this special celebration where we
                  invited scholarship holders and former scholarship holders,
                  staff and former staff, suppliers, partners and hotel friends
                  to celebrate with us the effort, dedication and achievements
                  that we have built together.

                  2023 was an extremely good year for our hotel in Oaxaca. We
                  witnessed the tremendous increase in the popularity of Oaxaca
                  since the pandemic, and the great interest from all over the
                  world in visiting the city. With an average occupancy of no
                  less than 91%, we experienced our best year since the hotel
                  opened in 2018. It took a lot of hard work and motivation from
                  our staff to keep up and meet the high expectations created by
                  the online reviews. But we made it through, and once again
                  this year many guests have expressed exceptionally
                  appreciative comments about our great service, the beautiful
                  installations, the helpfulness of the staff, the excellent
                  breakfast and last but not least our highly valued social
                  focus.

                  This year was also an important year for us as we celebrated
                  our fifth anniversary in June. With a lavish party for our
                  staff, suppliers and friends, the moment did not go unnoticed!

                  We are pleased with our 2023 results and we are confident that
                  we will continue to make our guests feel happy and at home
                  while supporting our social mission.

                "Excellent experience all around. I moved here after staying my
                first couple nights at another (more expensive) hotel close by
                and immediately wished I had booked my entire Granada vacation
                here! Everything from the friendly, professional staff to the
                very clean room and pool area was fantastic. The room was
                minimalist, but had everything needed and was very comfortable
                (it appeared like perhaps it had been recently renovated). The
                breakfast was solid and service was fast. I wish every hotel in
                Nicaragua had the same standards. I highly recommend staying
                here."

                "I would recommend this place to anyone. It's got a fresh modern
                feel with very comfortable beds and nice spaces for relaxing.
                The breakfasts are delicious, substantial and lovingly
                presented. But above all, it's the warmth of the people who work
                here that make it different from so many other hotels. You can
                tell they care about the hotel and its educational projects and
                that the hotel in turn cares about them. It feels very simple
                and homely - everything you could need (and nothing you don't).
                The location is also great…"

                "We had a great vacation to Oaxaca and most of the credit for
                that goes to Hotel con Corazón. Rooms were gorgeous and clean;
                staff were friendly and flexible; A/C in our room; breakfast was
                outstanding and the coffee was good. Walkable to city center. We
                booked multiple tours and cooking classes through the hotel, and
                had positive experiences at each one. They took great care of
                us, while re-investing in their community through education
                programs."

            I get up at 5:00 in the morning, brush my teeth, then I get ready to
            go out to do exercise, I return home at 6:00 and I freshen up a bit
            taking a bath, I get ready, have breakfast, brush my teeth again and
            leave my house at 6:40 to be at work at 7:00.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I arrive I wish my coworkers a good morning, and I proceed to
            perform my corresponding tasks: cleaning public areas, helping my
            coworkers in the kitchen, assisting customers, serving breakfast and
            washing dishes. When I finish helping them, I go to my area to clean
            the rooms, either for departure or stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            At 10:30 I clean the breakfast area, bar and tutoring area, at 12:30
            I have lunch with my colleagues, we finish lunch, I wash the dishes
            I used, I go to the laundry to wash and fold the bed linen and
            towels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then at 3:00 pm I clean the public areas and leave everything in
            order. My shift ends at 3:30 pm.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I get home, I freshen up a bit and get ready to bring my
            little brother to school, he leaves at 5:30 pm. I am a big fan of
            practicing sports, so in the evenings I play soccer for an hour or
            so and then I go home to have dinner, watch TV for a while and then
            go to sleep!

            My day starts between 6 and 7 in the morning. When I wake up, the
            first thing I like to do is to comtemplate the tender rays of the
            sun from my window and sit down to write down all my tasks and
            activities for the day, that is, my routine, from eating breakfast
            to work in the hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part of my morning routine is to have breakfast, clean my room,
            embroider and make beaded bracelets because I love handicrafts, make
            accounts of my finances, attend to a social and environmental
            project that some friends and I do in a kindergarden in the
            community of Atzompa. I do laundry, do some graphic design and
            update the social networks of the Huertonitos Urbanos (Urban
            Vegetable Gardens) collective of which I am a part.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early afternoon I start getting ready to go to the hotel,
            where my shift starts at 3:00 pm. I shower, take my backpack and my
            bicycle - my main means of transportation - and leave home at 14:50,
            because I live near the hotel and it takes me less than 10 minutes
            to get there.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I start my shift, my morning reception colleague shares with me
            the details and pendings of the day, I count the petty cash and
            check how many reservations are still to arrive; I review and answer
            emails, as well as any request or question from our guests or future
            guests who contact us through the platforms or call us on the phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every other week on Mondays, at the beginning of my shift, I
            participate in the English class for the staff, offered by the
            hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I usually take some time for lunch, then I clean up my
            area according to the schedule, go up to the terraces to check that
            the water stations are stocked, the chairs arranged, and take care
            of the herb garden if necessary; I greet guests for check-in and
            tell them along the way about the hotel's mission and how they
            support the local community.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so at 8 pm, it's my turn to greet my night watch colleague, with
            whom I also exchange details of occupancy and pending things.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 9 pm onwards I start closing my shift by making the day's bar
            charges to the respective room accounts. I close the card charge
            account via a report, count petty cash, print out the list of
            overnights for the night watch and the next day's checkout list for
            the morning shift. Then I write down the last indications in the log
            book, and at 10 pm I go home, to rest lying down reading a book or
            consulting my cell phone for a while until I fall asleep around 11
            or 11:30 pm, thus recharging batteries for a new day.

                The recovery of tourism in Nicaragua is reflected in our
                figures. With occupancy reaching 50% and room rates steadily
                increasing, our operating profits are starting to improve.
                Unfortunately, we still have some overdue projects in terms of
                maintenance, renovation and improvements, which is reflected in
                the extraordinary costs. It means the hotel is still not able to
                contribute enough to the education projects, but we expect this
                to change next year.

                After a record breaking 2022, this past year showed an even
                better performance. Oaxaca continues to be one of the top
                tourist destinations in Latin American, which is noticeable in
                our occupancy and room rates. Increases in room rates and the
                three additional rooms we built in early 2023 have contributed
                to revenues. It required a small increase in housekeeping and
                kitchen staff, but, as can be seen, the profit margin has
                increased significantly.

                For the Monteverde hotel in Costa Rica (hotel number 3) we
                expect construction to be completed in January 2025, with the
                hotel scheduled to open on April 1. At the time of writing, all
                three buildings are taking shape, with the three story main
                building being the priority.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are currently evaluating different options for hotel number
                4. Given the steady increase in tourism and success of our
                current hotel in that city, we are considering a second hotel in
                Oaxaca. In parallel, we are evaluating opportunities in San
                Cristóbal de las Casas in the neighboring state of Chiapas, as
                well as a beach hotel on the coast of Oaxaca.

                At the end of 2023 several of our students graduated and others
                were no longer eligible for scholarships, either because their
                financial situation had improved or because their motivation had
                dropped to unacceptable levels. We recruited more students and
                started 2024 with 32 students, 18 of whom are university
                students, thanks in part to increased hotel profits.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the resumption of flights to Managua from major U.S.
                airlines, there are now 16 international arrivals per day, a
                sign that international tourism is clearly on the mend. We are
                benefiting from many Costa Rican tour operators adding Nicaragua
                to their group itineraries. In summary, 2024 will produce
                revenues surpassing US$ 200,000 and operating profits of US$
                60,000.

                Our work with partner The Oaxaca Learning Center continues to be
                very fruitful. After 3 years, in June they will complete the
                renovation of their building and will be fully operational again
                with functioning classrooms, a computer space sponsored by Hotel
                con Corazón, office space for staff and recreation space for the
                students. Their goal of reaching over 200 students will easily
                be exceeded this year. We are excited with our extended
                partnership in Oaxaca with NGO Mundo de Talentos. They are
                expected to start a second cohort of students in a village
                outside of Oaxaca in September 2024, growing from 60 to 80
                students.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the hotel, the first 5 months of 2024 are showing strong
                occupancy and booking levels, in line with record levels in
                2023. We expect revenues to reach US$ 725,000 and net profits of
                US$ 208,000.
              </p>
              <p>
                In early 2024, it became clear that water scarcity would become
                an urgent problem in Oaxaca and would only increase in the
                future. Therefore, in May 2024, we will install a water
                treatment plant to irrigate our plants with treated water
                instead of drinking water. Once this plant is fully operational,
                we also expect to install gray water treatment later in 2024,
                adding another element to our responsible operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the first time in our operations, we expect to pay a
                dividend to our investors who contributed to the construction of
                the Oaxaca hotel. It makes us extremely proud, as it is a sign
                that we have transformed from a nonprofit to a social
                enterprise.
